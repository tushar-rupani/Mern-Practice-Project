### What did I learn?

Unlike PHP or other technologies, the idea of MERN is to divide the front and back ends of the application. I started by building an API with Node and Express.
The Back-End server portion's file structure looked somewhat like this.

I used the database at [https://cloud.mongodb.com/](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)Â  . Making sure your IP is registered in MongoDB is always a good idea.

I also learned how the Node API works. the controller code for the routes and the GET and POST requests.

How to Create Data and Retrieve Data from MongoDB. Compared to SQL, it was less difficult. The MongoDB online edition has a fairly great user experience.

I used material-UI with React for the design portion. Additionally, I discovered the functions of axios, redux, Provider, storage, and thunk.

Use of "useDispatch()" How react apps use action and reducers.

A few YouTube channels and StackOverflow were quite helpful.

The next objective is to learn database editing and deletion procedures.
